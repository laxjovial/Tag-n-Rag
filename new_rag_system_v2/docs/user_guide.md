## 3. Google Drive Integration (New in V2.0)

Version 2.0 allows you to connect your Google Drive account, giving you two powerful ways to work with your documents.

### 3.1. Connecting Your Account
1.  Navigate to the **Connect Data Source** page from the sidebar.
2.  Click the "Connect to Google Drive" button.
3.  You will be redirected to a Google consent screen. Follow the prompts to grant the application read-only access to your Drive files.
4.  Once complete, you will be redirected back to the application. The "Connection Status" tab will now show that you are connected.

### 3.2. Mode 1: Uploading from Google Drive
This mode copies files from your Google Drive into the application's managed storage. This is useful for files you want to query frequently without reconnecting.

1.  Go to the **Connect Data Source** page and select the **Upload from Google Drive** tab.
2.  You will see a browser for your Google Drive files.
3.  Select the checkboxes next to the files you wish to import.
4.  Click "Upload Selected Files". The files will be copied to the application and will now appear in your "View Documents" page like any other uploaded file.

### 3.3. Mode 2: Read-on-the-fly
This mode allows you to query files directly from your Google Drive without ever storing them on our servers.

**Step 1: Map a Category to a Drive Folder**
Before you can query in this mode, you must tell the application which folders to look in.
1.  Navigate to the **Manage Mappings** page.
2.  Create a category in our app if you haven't already (e.g., "Project Reports").
3.  In the "Create New Mapping" form, select your category.
4.  Paste the **Folder ID** from your Google Drive folder's URL.
5.  Give the folder a reference name and click "Create Mapping".

**Step 2: Querying Your Mapped Category**
1.  Go to the **Query** page.
2.  In the sidebar, select the "Category" query target.
3.  In the dropdown, you will see your mapped category, marked with a cloud icon (☁️).
4.  Select this category and ask your question. The system will read the files from the mapped folder in your Drive for this query only.

You have two ways to add documents:

*   **Create from Text:** Give your document a filename, type or paste the content, and save it.

### 4.2. Viewing and Managing Your Documents
The **View Documents** page is your central hub for managing your content. Here you can:

*   **Edit:** Click the "Edit" button next to any document to open an editor and modify its content.

2.  **Ask Your Question:** Type your question into the text box.
3.  **Adjust 'Creativity Control' (Optional):** This slider (formerly 'temperature') controls how creative the AI's answer will be. Lower values are better for direct, factual answers.

### 4.4. Personal Categories
To help organize your documents, you can create personal categories. When uploading or creating a document, you can assign it to one or more of your categories. You can manage your categories from the "Upload" and "Create from Text" pages. These categories are unique to your account and cannot be seen by other users.
