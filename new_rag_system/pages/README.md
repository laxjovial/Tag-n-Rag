# Frontend Pages

This directory contains the individual pages for the Streamlit multipage application. Streamlit automatically discovers these files and adds them to the navigation sidebar.

The number prefix in the filename (e.g., `0_Dashboard.py`) is used to control the order of the pages in the sidebar.

## Files
