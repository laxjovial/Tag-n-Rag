# Frontend Pages

This directory contains the individual pages for the Streamlit multipage application. Streamlit automatically discovers these files and adds them to the navigation sidebar.

The number prefix in the filename (e.g., `0_Dashboard.py`) is used to control the order of the pages in the sidebar.

## Files

-   `0_Dashboard.py`: The main user dashboard, serving as a central hub.
-   `1_Upload.py`: The page for uploading new documents.
-   `2_View_Documents.py`: The page for viewing and managing existing documents.
-   `3_Query.py`: The main interface for querying documents.
