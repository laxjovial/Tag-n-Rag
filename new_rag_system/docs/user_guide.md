3.  **Choose Your Model (Optional):** You can select from different AI models to answer your question. Each model has different strengths.
4.  **Adjust the "Temperature" (Optional):** The temperature slider controls how creative the AI's answer will be.
    *   **Low temperature (e.g., 0.1):** The AI will give more direct, factual answers based on the text.
    *   **High temperature (e.g., 0.9):** The AI might be more creative and generate more diverse responses.
    For factual questions, it's best to keep this low.
